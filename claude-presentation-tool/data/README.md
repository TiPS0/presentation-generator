# Data & Reference Folder

This folder serves as a **knowledge base** for your presentations.

## Purpose

Store text files, data dumps, or markdown notes here that contain the **source information** you want to present.

## How to Use

1.  **Save Data**: Create a file (e.g., `roadmap_2024.md` or `q3_metrics.txt`) in this folder.
2.  **Reference in Prompt**: When asking Claude to generate a slide, paste the content of these files or refer to them if using a project context.

## Example Workflow

1.  You have a file `data/project_phases.txt` containing a list of milestones.
2.  In your chat with Claude:
    > "Create a 'Process Flow' slide based on the milestones in `project_phases.txt`."
3.  Claude uses that specific data to populate the slide content accurately.
