# 🎫 CollabX Ticket Concept for Marketing Teams (Marketing & LINE OA)

This document explains the concept of using the **CollabX Ticket** system to help Marketing teams manage customers from **LINE Official Account (LINE OA)** channels with maximum efficiency, transforming from "generic chat response" to systematic "Lead Management".

## 🛑 Pain Points for Marketing Teams

1.  **Missed Chats / Slipping through cracks**: When broadcasting ads or promotions, a large volume of customers message simultaneously, causing inability to respond in time and messages getting pushed down.
2.  **Inability to Qualify Leads**: Mixed messages between "Hot Leads" (customers ready to buy) and "Cold Leads" (customers just asking).
3.  **Difficult Handoff to Sales**: When a chat concludes, admins have to screenshot conversations to send to Sales, or Sales have to re-ask the customer for information.
4.  **Unmeasurable Performance**: Cannot track which admin responds fastest or which campaign actually generates closed sales.

## 🚀 How CollabX Ticket Solves These Problems

### 1. Centralized "One-Inbox" (Consolidate all LINE OA accounts)

No need to switch accounts. CollabX Ticket gathers messages from every LINE OA of the brand into a single screen.

- **Auto-Assign**: When a customer messages from Campaign A -> System creates a Ticket and assigns it to **Marketing Team A** immediately.
- **Queue System**: Prioritizes response queues based on incoming time, preventing cherry-picking.

### 2. Lead Qualification Process

Transform Admins into **Lead Qualifiers** using Tag and Status systems.

```text
[Customer Messages]: "Interested in condo promotion"
      │
      ▼
[Ticket Created]: Assigned to Admin Marketing
      │
      ▼
[Admin Replies]: Provides initial information
      │
      ▼
[Admin Tags]: #HotLead #Interested-Sukhumvit
```

### 3. Seamless Handoff to Sales

Once qualified as a genuinely interested customer, no need to screenshot chats! Use the **Transfer Ticket** feature.

1.  Admin clicks **Transfer** button ➡️ Selects **Sales Team**.
2.  Specify Note: _"Customer interested in corner unit, budget 5M, initial discussion done, ready for viewing appointment."_
3.  **Sales** receives Notification and can view **entire chat history** immediately (Context preserved).
4.  Sales closes the deal (Status: **Closed (Won)**).
